# PythonWebscraping
I recently had to web scrape a lot of pdfs that were publicly available on the internet and I thought this would be helpful to share. Especially in the legal industry (who were my stakeholder for this project) this is a common request, so I thought I'd share. 
I relied on 2 excel files (surprise our old friend excel is still a key dependency in 2025) with the following data: 
1.	A table with document URLs 
2.	A table with ISINs ( these were finance documents)
